# Team-Profile-Generator

Team-Profile-Generator allows the user to create a GUI list of members on their development team. The user is prompted by the terminal if they would like to add a member; entering 'Y'|| 'y' will send the user to a list of various question about the specific team member being added. After adding a member to the team the user will be prompted with adding another member Entering 'Y'|| 'y', entering 'N'|| or 'n' will stop the application. When the application is complete the team roster will be generated from 'team.html'. The user is able to add team members from the categories: Manager, Intern, and Engineer; all stemming from the 'Employee' class.

This application was a lot of fun to make. During production I learned a lot about testing with Jest. I came into one failed test, luckily, and I was able to solve it pretty quickly. Jest came in handy because I would not have located that issue without it.
